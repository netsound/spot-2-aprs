Spot Tracker to APRS-IS Perl Script


This script uses the API Json data from findmespot.com and converts to APRS-IS format and posts to aprs-is stream.

You must have a spot tracker setup and transmitting data to a public share page.  You will need the API Key generated for that share page.

You can setup the script in cron to run every X based on your plan from spot.
